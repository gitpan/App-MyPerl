NAME
    App::MyPerl - Your very own set of perl defaults, on a per project basis

SYNOPSIS
      # .myperl/modules
      v5.14
      strictures
      autodie=:all

      $ myperl bin/some-script

    Runs some-script with the following already loaded

      use v5.14;
      use strictures;
      use autodie qw(:all);

    and through the magic of lib::with::preamble, 'lib/' and 't/lib' are
    already in @INC but files loaded from there will behave as if they had
    those lines in them, too.

    To run tests do -

      $ myprove t/foo.t

    And in your Makefile.PL -

      sub MY::postamble {
        q{distdir: myperl_rewrite
      myperl_rerite: create_distdir
            myperl-rewrite $(DISTVNAME)
      };
      }

    to have the defaults added to the top of .pm, .t and bin/* files in your
    dist when it's built for CPAN.
